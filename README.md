This project is a culmination of code written by the San Diego Taxpayers Educational Foundation to conduct a statistical analysis on Police, Firefighter, Teachers, and Engineers and their respective labor union financial backings.

This repo serves to organize the SDCTA data science team workflow. The purpose of our analysis is to show statistical evidence of government employees of our unions of interest moving around San Diego County for the primary purpose of increasing their annual wage.

A Code Dictionary and data dictionary are currently being implemented into the repo wiki.

This repo contains the code of the SDCTA data science team which includes: Ashvin Chaudhary, Brandon Miner, Brian Liu, Eric Jung, Khalil Burrell, and Ryan Penkala (Lead).
